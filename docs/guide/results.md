# Results

This page demonstrates how to use [OFFlimits bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=728332591790293044&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=268445752&client_id=728332591790293044) to calculate results.

## About

Results is a slash command that is used to calculate games results
and sort teams according to a specific points system that can be
customized [setpoints](/guide/points-system).
Later after using the command, the outcome can be used to generate
beautiful results images [board](/guide/board).

<YandexAD :blockId="R-A-8300744-1"></YandexAD>

Results command can be used in any channel or thread that has the word `results` in its name, and can be used in multiple channels to calculate different results.

## Requirements

Before using the command you have to setup OFFlimits bot in your
server, and to do that you need to use the command [setup](/guide/setup), which will create 2 channels:

<DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot">
			<template #interactions>
				<DiscordInteraction profile="test" :command="true">setup</DiscordInteraction>
			</template>
✅ | Created <DiscordMention type="channel">results-bot</DiscordMention>
</DiscordMessage>
<DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot">
✅ | Created <DiscordMention type="channel">operations</DiscordMention>
</DiscordMessage>

If you already have these channels you can skip [setup](/guide/setup).

## Usage

Lets say we have the results of 2 games for `Team One`.
**Input**

```txt:no-line-numbers
10th place                     1st place
Player A      3 kills          Player A      5 kills
Player B      1 kills          Player B      2 kills
Player C      0 kills          Player C      4 kills
Player D      1 kills          Player D      1 kills
```

For entering results data we use the channel `#results-bot`.

::: tip
If the team name has numbers in it or the team name is a number, write it within `[ ]` brackets, Ex: `[Team 99]`
:::

- In our example case the name is Team One

Now we array points after name in the following order:

`Team Name [rank 1] [kills 1] [rank 2] [kills 2] and so on to infinity.`

<DiscordMessage profile="test">
<DiscordMarkdown>
Team-One 10 5 1 12
{{ '\n' }}
Team-Two 10 5 1 12
</DiscordMarkdown>
</DiscordMessage>

## Sending the command

After writing down all teams we send the command `/results calculate` in the channel.

<DiscordMessage profile="test" >
<DiscordMarkdown>
Team-One 10 5 1 12
{{ '\n' }}
Team-Two 10 5 1 12
</DiscordMarkdown>
</DiscordMessage>
<DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot">
			<template #interactions>
				<DiscordInteraction profile="test" :ephemeral="true" :command="true">results</DiscordInteraction>
			</template>
			OFFlimits is thinking...
		</DiscordMessage>

## Outcome

<YandexAD :blockId="R-A-8300744-1"></YandexAD>

After a few seconds the bot will send a leaderboard table in `#results-bot` channel.

<DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot">
			<template #interactions>
				<DiscordInteraction profile="test" :ephemeral="true" :command="true">results</DiscordInteraction>
			</template>
			
```txt:no-line-numbers
           RESULTS LEADERBOARD
  #      name     total   wins   KP   PP

1.        Team-One    33    1     17   16
2.        Team-Two    33    1     17   16

```
