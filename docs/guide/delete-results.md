# Delete Results

This page demonstrates how clear and backup the results generated by [OFFlimits bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=728332591790293044&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=268445752&client_id=728332591790293044).

## About 
  
Delete-results is a command that is used to delete the content of `#results-bot` channel and create a backup file for it, that will be sent to `#operations`.

## Requirements 
  
Before using the command you have to setup OFFlimits bot in your 
 server, and to do that you need to use the command [setup](/guide/setup), which will create 2 channels: 
  
<DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot"> 
                         <template #interactions> 
                                 <DiscordInteraction profile="test" :command="true">setup</DiscordInteraction> 
                         </template> 
 ✅ | Created <DiscordMention type="channel">results-bot</DiscordMention> 
 </DiscordMessage> 
 <DiscordMessage :bot="true" profile="bot"> 
 ✅ | Created <DiscordMention type="channel">operations</DiscordMention> 
</DiscordMessage> 
  
If you already have these channels you can skip [setup](/guide/setup).

## Usage

Send the command `/delete-results`.

::: tip
If you have multiple results channels, use the command in the channel you want to delete content of and create a backup for.
