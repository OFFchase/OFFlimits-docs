## About

Board is a slash command that generates beautiful leaderboard designs and images

## Requirements

Before using the command you have to setup OFFlimits bot in your
server, and to do that you need to use the command [setup](/guide/setup), which will create 2 channels:

> `#operations`
>
> `#results-bot`

If you already have these channels you can skip [setup](/guide/setup).
